## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Version control is a system that tracks changes made to code, documents, or digital content over time. It allows multiple users to collaborate on a project by managing different versions of the content. The core concepts of version control include:

1. Repository (Repo): The central location where all files and history of changes are stored.
2. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the code, saved in the repository with a unique ID and description.
3. Branch: A separate line of development in the repository, allowing multiple versions to coexist.
4. Merge: Combining changes from two branches into a single branch.
5. Conflict: When changes made by different users clash, requiring manual resolution.

GitHub is a popular platform for version control because it:

1. Hosts repositories: Provides a cloud-based location for storing and managing code.
2. Offers collaboration tools: Enables multiple users to work together on projects, track changes, and communicate.
